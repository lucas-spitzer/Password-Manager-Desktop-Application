### Password Manager Desktop Application
Application built to store and manage passwords.

This application utilizes 2-factor authentication (Google Authenticator App) and one-time pad encryption. All one-time pad keys should be held on a separate drive. I recommend using USB drives for their portable nature. If you are afraid of losing your keys, it may be helpful to have a second drive with the same contents. By storing the keys and ciphertext on separate devices, both drive MUST be acquired in order to decipher your passwords. In addition, by setting up 2FA with the Google Authenticator App, a user needs access to that device (likely a phone) as well.
